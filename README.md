<strong>ADDITIONAL COMMENTS</strong><br>
Be careful that the text and images further down your page all align vertically as the
page gets smaller to a mobile size.Currently they are overshooting the boundaries of the
main color area. Also, once the sun disappears, there's an opportunity to balance
outsizing and positioning of the text and images that remain. Watch that top menu as
you have some passing in it that forces it from being centered. Your upcoming site is in
good shape to remedy these issues.
